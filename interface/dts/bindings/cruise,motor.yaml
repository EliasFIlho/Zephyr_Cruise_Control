    This binding provides resources required to use the pwm API with a generic application: This will be used to controll a motor later so now will be like this
compatible: "cruise,motor"

properties:
  pwms:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      PWM pins that will be used for generating and capturing a pulse-width
      modulated signal. The pin at the first index will be used for signal
      generation while the pin at the second index will be used for capuring
      the generated signal.

      description: |
        Human readable string describing the gpio pin. It can be used by an
        application to identify this pin or to retrieve its number/index
        (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.
